        <h3>The Global Vipassana Pagoda is a Meditation dome hall with a capacity to seat around 8,000 Vipassana meditators 
            (the largest such meditation hall in the world) near Gorai, north-west of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The pagoda was 
            inaugurated by Pratibha Patil, then President of India, on 8 February 2009. It is built on donated land on a peninsula
            between Gorai creek and the Arabian Sea. The pagoda is to serve as a monument of peace and harmony. The Global Vipassana 
            Pagoda has been built out of gratitude to Sayagyi U Ba Khin (1899 - 1971), Vipassana teacher and the first Accountant-General 
            of Independent Burma, who was instrumental in Vipassana returning to India, the country of its origin. 
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The center of the Global Vipassana Pagoda contains the world's largest stone dome built without any supporting pillars. The 
            height of the dome is approximately 29 meters, while the height of the building is 99.06 meters, which is twice the size of the previously 
            largest hollow stone monument in the world, the Gol Gumbaz Dome in Bijapur, India. The external diameter of the largest 
            section of the dome is 97.46 m and the shorter sections are 94.82m. The internal diameter is 85.15 m. The inside of the 
            pagoda is hollow and serves as a very large meditation hall with an area covering more than 6000 m2 (65,000 ft2). The massive 
            inner dome seats over 8000 people enabling them to practice the non-sectarian Vipassana meditation as taught by S. N. Goenka 
            and now being practiced in over 100 countries. An inaugural one-day meditation course was held at the pagoda on 21 December 
            2008, with Goenka in attendance as the teacher.Ten-day vipassana meditation courses are held free of charge at the Dhamma 
            Pattana meditation center that is part of the Global Vipassana Pagoda complex.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The foundation of the dome consists of basalt, 
            while the dome itself is made from sandstone brought from Rajasthan. The individual blocks of sandstone weigh 600â€“700 kg each 
            and are kept in place due to the unique design of the bricks. Each of the bricks interlock with the ones adjacent to it and 
            lime mortar is used to fill in any remaining gaps. The circumambulation path is laid in marble. The pinnacle of the pagoda is 
            adorned with a large crystal. The spire is covered in real gold, while the rest of the pagoda is covered in gold paint. The 
            spire is topped with a special ornamental umbrella piece donated by the Burmese. The main doors to the pagoda are wooden and 
            hand-carved in Myanmar (Burma).

        <h3>Sanjay Gandhi National Park, also known as SGNP, is an 87 km2 (34 sq mi) protected area in Mumbai, Maharashtra. It was 
            established in 1969 with its headquarters situated at Borivali. The 2400-year-old Kanheri caves, sculpted by monks out of 
            the rocky basaltic cliffs, lie within the park. The rich flora and fauna of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park attract more than 
            2 million visitors every year.</h3>
        <h3>
            The area of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park has a long written history dating back to the 4th century BC. In Ancient India, 
            Sopara and Kalyan were two ports in its vicinity that traded with ancient civilisations such as Greece and Mesopotamia. The 45 
            km (28 mi) land route between these two ports was partially passing through this forest. The Kanheri caves, located centrally 
            in the park, were important Buddhist learning centres and pilgrimage sites sculpted by Buddhist monks (using primitive 
            sculpting tools) between the 9th and the 1st centuries BCE. They were chiselled out of a massive basaltic rock outcropping.
             The monks carved exquisite Buddhist carvings and designs within the caves, and even had properly built spaces designated 
            as kitchens, dining halls, etc., with drainages built alongside the halls.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The park is forestland, with an estimated 800 types of mauve. This flower is native to the park and the surrounding regions, 
            including Karnala, the Yeoor hills, Tungareshwar, and some parts of Goregaon's Film City. The park is also home to a small 
            population of leopards.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The park is home to a number of endangered species of flora and fauna. The forest area of the park houses over 1,000 plant 
            species, 251 species of migratory, land, and water birds, 5,000 species of insects, and 40 species of mammals. In addition, 
            the park also provides shelter to 38 species of reptiles, 9 species of amphibians, 150 species of butterflies, and a large 
            variety of fish.
